**Basic Pipeline Project**

**Overview**
This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is designed to interact with the Open Library API. It fetches data about books and authors, processes this data to extract meaningful insights, and stores the results in a structured format. The project is structured for scalability and can be integrated with cloud services for enhanced functionality.

**Project Structure**
src: Contains the source code for the project.
api/api_handler.py: Handles API requests to the Open Library API and retrieves data based on specified parameters.
data-output: Stores the output files, including processed data in CSV format.
database: (Future implementation) Will handle interactions with a database for storing processed data.
processing: Consists of modules for data processing.
AGGS/calc_handler.py: Contains functions for data aggregation and calculations.
CONFIG/config.json: Configuration file for specifying which data columns to process.
HANDLERS/processors.py: Transforms raw data into structured dataframes and outputs to CSV files.
utils: Includes utility functions and configurations.
config.py: Manages general configurations and AWS credentials.
main.py: The main script that orchestrates the ETL process.
tests: (Future implementation) Will include unit tests for the project components.

Setup Instructions
Environment Setup: Ensure Python 3.10 is installed on your system.

**Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages:**
pip install pandas requests boto3

**AWS Credentials:** Set up AWS credentials for accessing AWS Parameter Store and S3 services. This can be done by configuring the AWS CLI or setting environment variables.


**Configuration:** Modify the src/utils/config.json and src/processing/CONFIG/config.json files as needed to adjust the pipeline's settings.
Running the Pipeline

**To execute the pipeline:**

bash
Copy code
python src/main.py
This command triggers the ETL process, fetching data from the API, processing it, and storing the results in src/data-output.

**Dependencies**
Python: Version 3.x
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Requests: For making API requests.
Boto3: For AWS services integration, such as S3 and Parameter Store.

**Future Enhancements**
Database Integration: Implement the database module to store processed data in a database like Snowflake or AWS RDS.
Unit Testing: Add unit tests in the tests directory to ensure code reliability and facilitate maintenance.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling and logging for more robust pipeline execution.
CI/CD Integration: Setup CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
